# inline-grid


CSS Grid using inline-block elements. An alternative grid using 
Bootstrap's familiar naming convention for classes (col-xs-#, col-xs-offset-#). 
12 & 10 col grid available (col-xs-(1-12) & col-xs-(1-10)-10))

This project came from a desire to switch from a float based grid layout (Bootstrap - which is a great framework). I just wanted to created something that I could quickly use & modify in future projects. Support for Flexbox is right around the corner, woo! But until then, feel free to use this grid (pixel values supplied in comments by the em units).
